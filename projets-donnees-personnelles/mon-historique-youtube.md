Lately, I downloaded **my youtube datas** from 2018 to mid-june 2022, and started to see some great insights that made me realize how active I was 🤔. Here are **five** of them 💡:

1. I clicked on the **like button** for **27.4%** of the videos I have seen, which is **more than 1/4 of 17k videos**. 🎥 

2. On **August 2018**, I have seen **1315** videos, which means I have watched on **average over 40 videos per day**. I was actually using youtube as my **main music streaming platform**. I also used to leave youtube all night long while sleeping...

3. On september 24th 2019, I **have seen 127 videos**. This is my most active record day. I don't even remember why I've done this. 🤯

4. I have seen **1256 videos through the wednesdays of 2019** - Wednesday was actually a day of my full remote work so I used to listen to some youtube music while working. 💻

5. My 5 most searched words and the related song I've been looking for:
